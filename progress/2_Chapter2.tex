\section{Compliance}
    \subsection{Definition}
        (TODO: Definition of Compliance)

    \subsection{Cyber essentials use case}
        "The Government worked with the Information Assurance for Small and Medium Enterprises (IASME) consortium and the Information Security Forum (ISF) to develop Cyber Essentials, a set of basic technical controls to help organisations protect themselves against common online security threats." (Cyber Essentials Scheme: overview (2014) GOV.UK.)

    \subsection{The State of Compliance in the UK (crime stats)}
    "We have seen a significant growth in cyber criminality in the form of high-profile ransomware campaigns over the last year. Breaches leaked personal data on a massive scale leaving victims vulnerable to fraud, while lives were put at risk and services damaged by the WannaCry ransomware campaign that affected the NHS and many other organisations worldwide. Tactics are currently shifting as businesses are targeted over individuals..." (Cyber Crime (no date) NCA National Crime Agency.)

    \subsection{Impact}
        Cyber attacks are financially devastating and disrupting and upsetting to people and businesses. We know that there is significant under-reporting, although the new General Data Protection Regulation is likely to prompt a better picture of scale. Currently the level of sentencing at court is not commensurate with the seriousness of attacks, and this is an area which is ripe for consideration.
