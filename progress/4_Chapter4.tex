\chapter{WORK COMPLETED AND REMAINING}

\section{Work to Date}
    At the time of writing, the project has just finished its design phase and will shortly be moving into implementation. So far, extensive background reading into compliance, cyber security, supply chains and cyber crime has been conducted, including the impacts and consequences of successful cyber attacks. A problem area has been identified in the cost of conforming to compliance standards, and the difficultly of SMEs in achieving said compliance. From this, a solution has been proposed, a list of requirements devised and a series of designs for the functionality of the solution have been produced.

\section{A Plan for the Work Remaining}
    Remaining work includes the implementation of the application, the testing and validation of the completed product, and composing the final report. A plan of the all the work to be done has been made in the form of a Gantt chart, shown overleaf.
